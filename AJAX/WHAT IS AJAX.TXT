What is AJAX?
AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.

AJAX is not a programming language.

AJAX just uses a combination of:
    1. A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
    2. JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)



The keystone of AJAX is the XMLHttpRequest object.

The XMLHttpRequest Object
All modern browsers support the XMLHttpRequest object.

The XMLHttpRequest object can be used to exchange data with a web server behind the scenes.
This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.
